Both of your parties have spoken about the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As experts, we know this technology’s potential more than most. However, any powerful technology needs good governance, and AI is no exception.

Aotearoa New Zealand, much like the rest of the world, currently stands at a crossroads. We are at a crucial point in history, where we as a nation must decide how AI will influence our lives. We all want New Zealand to prosper. And we agree that AI has a major role to play. But it must be used in a safe and responsible manner. We need strong bipartisan leadership to achieve this.

Many New Zealanders do not trust AI. In fact, we’re ranked [third-to-last](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai.html) of 47 nations in global AI trust statistics. We’re also ranked poorly in reports like the [Global Index on Responsible AI](https://www.global-index.ai/) and [Government AI Readiness Index](https://oxfordinsights.com/ai-readiness/ai-readiness-index/), well behind our OECD partners.

It is not surprising that we’re untrusting. AI is being hyped by major tech companies worldwide, who often overstate the capabilities of their products. And for every positive article or press release, there is another news story highlighting AI harms. These harms are numerous and urgent: the proliferation of [gender-based online harm](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr58dlnne5o), [child sexual abuse imagery](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/18/artificial-intelligence-child-sexual-abuse-imagery-watchdog-iwf), [fraud](https://theconversation.com/can-you-spot-a-financial-fake-how-ai-is-raising-our-risks-of-billing-fraud-253912), [algorithmic bias](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/13/ai-artificial-intelligence-racism-sexism-australia-human-rights-commissioner), [hallucinations](https://theconversation.com/what-are-ai-hallucinations-why-ais-sometimes-make-things-up-242896), [misappropriation of intellectual property and art](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/australian-authors-sentiment-on-generative-ai), [workforce upheaval](https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400262548.006), [detrimental environmental impacts](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117), and even the [use of AI to undermine democracy itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/ai-elections-democracy.html).

Of course, AI can also be an incredible tool for good. Our regulatory response must be proportional, focusing on managing the risks of AI so that it can benefit us all.  Regulation is not about red tape or stopping innovation. It is about providing businesses, researchers, and the public with clear parameters within which to innovate safely and to build public trust. This could be through either new overarching AI legislation or a revision of existing laws to ensure they are fit for purpose.

We, as AI experts, are calling on you to lead a bipartisan effort to produce risk management-based AI regulation and to establish a national AI oversight body. The laws and policies that we put in place now will decide the impact of AI in New Zealand for decades and generations to come. We are ready and willing to assist in this effort.
